# Deep Dives

These exercises, which we call *deep dives*, will help you hone your coding skills by focusing on two key areas: *Decomposition* and *Discovery*.

## Decomposition

*Decomposition* is the skill of breaking down a problem into smaller parts. Even the most experienced software developer cannot look at a complex problem and immediately develop a solution to solve it. Instead, the key is to identify and break down a complex problem into smaller problems which are more easily solveable. 

All of these deep dives are complex - and they're meant to be. If you find these to be difficult, it doesn't mean that your coding skills are mediocre. The entire idea here is that we're giving you tough problems so that you can practice the skill of breaking them down into easier ones. And even if you don't end up fully completing a given deep dive - if you solve some of its smaller problems, that's also a big win.

Part of each deep dive, then, involves thinking about how to break the exercise down into smaller parts. You should make sure to take significant time in identifying the smaller parts before you even type your first character of code. If you skip straight to the coding, you'll miss out on the opportunity to practice these critical skills of decomposition.

## Discovery

*Discovery* is the art and science of learning something new on your own. Believe it or not, a software engineer's job is to constantly learn new things. No developer already knows everything they need to accomplish even day-to-day tasks; they always need to be discovering new things.

Discovery - especially around topics of software - is not a skill that comes naturally to anyone. You need to actively learn *how to learn* new things.

Discovery involves learning how to research concepts using Google, learning how to read documentation, learning how to follow a tutorial, and more.

Many of these deep dives require you to work with a concept or technology *that you've never even heard of*. At first glance, one might wonder, "How am I supposed to do an exercise that involves a technology I know nothing about?"

And that's the whole idea. These deep dives give you the opportunity to practice the skill of discovery. You'll gain proficiency in learning *how to learn*. And you'll also surprise yourself in what you're able to accomplish on your own. And over time, the intimidation inherent in working with an unfamiliar topic will fade away.

## Last Word

Some of these exercises focus mainly on decomposition, some on discovery, and some on both. Remember, these are all extra challenging by design. By no means should you measure your own skills by these exercises; the whole idea is that the extra challenge will spur you to further growth.

Good luck!
